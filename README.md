Final project Social Network Analysis (Master Big Data and AI)

The objective of the final project for the Social Network Analysis course is to apply the knowledge and skills acquired during the course to analyze a real social network. This project will enable a better understanding of the dynamics of social relationships and network structures in a specific context. 

In particular we analyzed Arxiv HEP-TH (high energy physics theory) citation graph. This graph is from arXiv and covers all the citations. Edges from u to v indicate that a paper u cited another paper v. If a paper cites, or is cited by, a paper outside the dataset, the graph does not contain any information about this. The data is of the papers in the period from January 1993 to April 2003.

The project consists of four parts.

**Project Structure:**

1. **Identification of the Initial Dataset**
   Select a network of interest from the networkrepository site, defining its context, the type of nodes (individuals, organizations, etc.), and the connections (relationships, interactions, etc.). The chosen network must consist of at least 15-20,000 nodes.

2. **Analyze the Network Structure**
   Use the network measures introduced in the first part of the course (degree distribution, density, clustering coefficient, centrality, assortativity, etc.) to characterize the selected dataset.

3. **Compare the Network with Null Models**
   Compare the statistics calculated on the selected network with the expected values in the main null models discussed in class (ER, BA). Discuss and interpret the observed differences/similarities.

4. **Analysis Task (Chosen by the Students)**
   Select N analysis tasks from those proposed (where N is the number of group members minus 1), apply them to the selected network, and discuss the results obtained.
